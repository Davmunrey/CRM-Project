# Smoke checklist — production (Phase 10 gate)

Use this after a production deploy (or before marking **`DEPLOY-04`** done). Record pass/fail and who ran it.

**Before ticking `DEPLOY-*` in [`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`](../.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md):** add a dated evidence line (host, channel, smoke outcome, commit) per the “Recording DEPLOY completion” note in that file — automated agents prepare docs; humans own the checked boxes.

## Preconditions

- [ ] `VITE_APP_CHANNEL` is **`production`** for this deploy (not `staging`).
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` match the **production** Supabase project for this build.
- [ ] SPA deep links work ([`deployment-spa-and-env.md`](./deployment-spa-and-env.md)).
- [ ] Optional: Gmail restricted-scope verification status noted ([`google-gmail-oauth-verification.md`](./google-gmail-oauth-verification.md)).

## Core flows

1. **Signup (or invite)** — Create a user; confirm email if verification is enabled in Supabase.
2. **Login** — Sign in; no flash redirect loop on hard refresh of `/`.
3. **Organization** — User lands in org context (org setup or home); JWT carries `organization_id` where expected.
4. **Create contact** — Create a contact; reload page; record still visible.
5. **Log activity** — Attach activity to contact or deal; visible after navigation away and back.
6. **Team directory** — Open team / users UI; peer emails and names appear (backed by `list_organization_members_with_identity` RPC after migration `20260415120000_*`).
7. **Optional — Gmail** — Connect Gmail on production domain only if OAuth verification allows your test user.
8. **Manager dashboard** — As a user with **Reports read** (e.g. Manager preset), open `/manager` cold load; widgets render without console errors. Definitions, permissions, i18n keys, and tests: [`master-implementation-history` — Manager dashboard data contract](./master-implementation-history.md#manager-dashboard-data-contract).
9. **Onboarding** — Open `/settings?tab=onboarding`; toggle a checklist step, reload; state persists for the org. Optional: Dashboard banner appears when steps incomplete and banner not dismissed.

## Automated smoke (local / CI)

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Uses Playwright against the dev server by default. For an optional **hosted** URL, set `E2E_STAGING_URL` (see [`e2e/smoke.spec.ts`](../e2e/smoke.spec.ts)).

### Google OAuth — Vercel previews + production

- [ ] Preview deploy: connect Gmail → popup opens Google → production callback redirects to preview → exchange completes
- [ ] Production: connect Gmail → OAuth completes directly (no intermediate redirect)
- [ ] Revoke Google access from Google Account → next Gmail action shows reconnect message (not raw 401)
- [ ] Scheduled email with expired token → auto-refreshes and delivers
